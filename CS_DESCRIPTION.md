This mod addresses a bug where certain blocks and entities—such as vanilla paintings and Create mod blocks—do not rotate correctly when placed via jigsaw structures.

⚠️ Compatibility Warning:
This mod is specifically designed for the Chocolate Edition modpack. It uses overwrite-based patches and is not compatible with other mods that modify JigsawPlacement.addPieces via mixins. Conflicts will likely result in broken structure generation behavior.
